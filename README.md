#What is this?
This website is made by NoSkillCorp which is no company. Just a bunch of guys working on a side project.
We wanted to help share tips and ideas from the community of Overwatch players.
Content is completely anonymous, and there is no login required to vote or create a tip.

#Can you add this feature I just thought about ?
Yeah of course we can, we already have a bunch of extra features that we want to add, but we're open for any ideas.
Send us a tweet [@0verwatchTips](https://twitter.com/0verwatchTips) and we'll look at your proposal.

#I want to contribute
And you should ! Open an issue or make a pull request as much as you want.
If everyone could do this instead of requesting features, that would be great.

The website is built using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)

To run the website simply fork the master and run `bundle install`, `rake db:migrate`.
`rails s` to launch the server and you should be ready to go.

#Overwatch Tips API

An API is available if you want to create a chatbot or whatever using tips from [overwatch-tips.com](http://www.overwatch-tips.com)
See the documentation available [here](https://github.com/NoSkillCorp/overwatch-tips/blob/master/API.md).
