I've overheard on streams that people believe they're \"stealthed\" whenever they use his Wraith form, but it's primarily used as a tool to escape players when you're in danger, to reposition yourself in close-quarters to secure kills on targets that are foolish enough to follow you.")

    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "as", description: "Tracer's Ultimate Ability (Pulse Bomb) can be used like a \"sticky\" grenade (like the Plasma Grenade from Halo) to stick players with a devastating ability. Try to stick it on the enemy team when they're grouped up ontop of an objective.")
    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "against", description: "Enemy Tracer giving you problems? Play McCree or Mei. Seriously. McCree is one of the best characters equipped to dealing with Tracer. A quick flashback will stun her long enough for him to use a full round of his peacekeeper for an easy kill.")

    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "as", description: "Torbjorn's turret cannot see and handle everything on it's own. It's important for you to watch the back of your fellow Torbjorn teammates, because they're incredibly vulnerable to being picked off by the enemy team's offensive characters (including snipers like Widowmaker if he's not in an enclosed position).")
    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "as", description: "Torbjorn can drop armor packs for himself, but more importantly for his teammates whenever he has spare scrap, it's a nice way to support your team when you're already maxxed out your turrets.")

    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "against", description: "McCree's ultimate (Deadeye) can end up launching a kill shot on multiple targets in a very short amount of time. So, when you hear \"it's high-noon\" it's time to take cover IMMEDIATELY to avoid getting one-shot-killed!")
    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "against", description: "McCree is one of the most dangerous close-range fighters that you can encounter in Overwatch, if you have to fight him in close corners try to avoid his flash bang and attack him while he's reloading.")

    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "against", description: "If you notice the opposing team has a Symmetra, be careful of entering buildings in obscure locations. I've noticed many Symmetra players like to setup all of their turrets in rooms that are alternate pathes and routes to objectives, or around important map advantages like Health packs. If you step into a room, you'll be dead before you even realized what happened!")
    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "against", description: "Symmetra is capable of placing teleporters for her team to transfer through, keep an eye and an ear out in areas where you see large amounts of enemies randomly appearing from.

    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "against", description: "Pharah can only be in the air for a short period of time with her jetpack. That's because it requires fuel, so she can't stay up there forever! Try to grab her when she's on the ground if you can't get her when she's in the air.")
    
    character = Character.find_by(name: "Reinhardt")
    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "against", description: "Reinhardt is capable of pinning targets against walls and other nearby objects, which is usually more than enough to one shot squishies like Mercy. Always move when you're against Reinhardt!")
    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "against", description: "Reinhardt is able to pin targets off ledges as well to kill them while killing himself, but depending on when the \"pinning\" ends, it does allow some opponents a chance to recover and jump back onto the map (Tracer, Pharah, Genji, Reaper, Winston, Hanzo, and Widowmaker)")
    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "as", description: "Despite popular belief, Reinhardt's shield can be destroyed if it takes too much damage (over 2000), characters like Bastion can easily overwhelm his shield if he and his team position poorly.")

    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "against", description: "Junkrat's ultimate (Rip-Tire) is one of the most devastating abilities to use against opponents that are stacking ontop of an objective.

    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "as", description: "Genji's Swift Strike can be used to reposition himself, but primarily can be useful to secure kills on a target. After securing a kill your Swift Strike's cooldown is immediately refreshed and you can use it again.")

    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "against", description: "Soldier 76 has the unique ability to lock onto characters with his ultimate to guarentee high amounts of damage.

    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "against", description: "D.VA has one of the best ultimates in the game (self destruction), which can damage any enemy characters in a large radius.

It's a quick way to overwhelm and surprise your opponents!")

    character = Character.find_by(name: "Mei")
    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "against", description: "Mei is a character that you normally do not want to engage with on your own. If you end up getting frozen, it may be too late to turn around a fight! Try to engage on a Mei with other teammates to ensure a kill.")

    character = Character.find_by(name: "Widowmaker")
    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "against", description: "Widowmaker may be labeled as defense, but she is one of the most devastating characters to play against if you're a squishy. If the enemy team has a Widowmaker, try to communicate with your team about her position at all times so that characters like Winston can jump upon her to finish her off quickly!")
    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "against", description: "Widowmaker may be a sniper, but her rifle can be used to fire more rapidly in short ranged situations if she's discovered by other characters. Never assume that she's just going to be a free kill!")

    Tip.create(gaming_object: character, category: "as", description: "Mercy is capable of empowering teammates with a healing ray, or a damaging ray.
